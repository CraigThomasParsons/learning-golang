Laravel
Laravel is the most popular framework for php.
Easy database access.
A lot of functionality right out of the box.
Easy to install.

Downsides
Relatively slow, because it is written in PHP.
  - Also, sometimes the dependencies don't stay up to date.
Vast number of bad resources online.
  - These resources sometimes are just bad.
Horizontally scalable, but requires a lot of resources.
Individual installations requires a lot of system resources.

Celeritas:
Latin for "Speed"

We will build a command line application

With one command, we'll have a Go project that includes the following:

Features:
Easy access to multiple databases (we'll include Postgres and MySQL,
  but have support for Mongo, CocroachDB, and SQLite)
Complete user authetication (for web and api) with one command

Database migrations

Multiple HTML templating engines (Go teplates and Jet)

Sessions support

Generate handlers (like Laravel's controllers) and models with one.

Support for easy to write middleware

Form validation

CRSF protection

Encryption

Response utilities (XML, JSON, download a file)

Support for multiple caching back ends (Redis and BadgerDb)

Sending email via SMTP, SendGrid, MailGun, and Sparkpost

Remember me and password resets for user authetication.
